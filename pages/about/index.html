    <p> I am a first-year student at FEU Institute of Technology, pursuing a degree in Information Technology specializing in Business Analytics. My academic journey is centered on building a robust foundation in IT, complemented by an in-depth understanding of data analysis, statistical methods, and business intelligence. I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive strategic business decisions and improve operational efficiencies. My coursework includes data mining, predictive analytics, and business process optimization, which equip me with the necessary skills to analyze and interpret complex data sets.
        <br> <br>
        
        I am eager to gain practical experience in the field through internships and industry collaborations. My goal is to apply the analytical techniques and technological expertise I have acquired to solve real-world business problems. I am particularly interested in roles that involve data-driven decision-making, process improvement, and innovative solutions. By integrating my academic knowledge with hands-on experience, I aspire to contribute effectively to the growth and success of future employers.
